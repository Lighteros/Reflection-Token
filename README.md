# ReflectionToken
A safemoon fork with improved features.

This is a rewrite of Safemoon in the hope to:

   1.   Make it easier to change the tokenomics to make changes anf give  custom contract to clients in no time.
   2.   Make it easier to maintain the code and develop it further
   3.   Remove redundant code
   4.   Address Safemoon audit issues (SSL-01, 02, 03, 05, 06, 11, 12)
   5.   Correctly implemented burn
   6.   The right wallets excluded from rewards by default
